Django journal project and senitment analysis using GTP3 and NLTK. 

The main aim of this is to allow the user to track the sentiment of their journal entries overtime to be able to understand how positive, negative or neutral their views have been over time. 

Within this the program analyses the journal entries for Thought Distortions and distored thinking. This is so over time they can see if they are using different types of distorted thinking and patterns to help identify their thought behaviours. 

As the user adds more journal entries the analytics page will give them an overview of how their journal entries change in snetiment and thought distortions. 

The end goal for this project is to move away from Third party API's and train my own model to be able to analyse Journal entries, my main reasoning for this is to ensure the user data isn't used for any other purupose or to train otehr models

The maiun design principles I wanted to follow were all focused around simplicity. The UI aims to be simple but efficient in aiding the user in their goals.
