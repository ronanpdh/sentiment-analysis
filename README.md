# AVY
Django journal project and senitment analysis using GTP and NLTK. 

The main aim of this is to allow the user to track the sentiment of their journal entries overtime to be able to understand how positive, negative or neutral their views have been over time. 

Within this the program analyses the journal entries for Thought Distortions and distored thinking. This is so over time they can see if they are using different types of distorted thinking and patterns to help identify their thought behaviours. 

As the user adds more journal entries the analytics page will give them anm overview of how their journal entries change in snetiment and thought distortions.
